### Understanding Blockchain for Enterprises

#### Permissioned Blockchain

A **Permissioned Blockchain** is a type of blockchain where only authorized participants can join the network and validate transactions. This model is often used by enterprises that require more control over their blockchain environment.

##### Permissioned Model and Use Cases

- **Permissioned Model**: Unlike public blockchains, permissioned blockchains restrict access to authorized users. This ensures that only trusted entities can participate, making it suitable for business applications where privacy and control are crucial.

- **Use Cases**: 
  - **Supply Chain Management**: Track the movement of goods through a supply chain, ensuring transparency and reducing fraud.
  - **Financial Services**: Facilitate faster and more secure transactions, reduce fraud, and improve compliance.
  - **Healthcare**: Securely share patient data among hospitals and clinics while ensuring privacy.
  - **Government**: Streamline processes like voting, land registry, and identity verification.

##### Design Issues for Permissioned Blockchains

1. **Access Control**: Defining who can join the network and what permissions they have.
2. **Privacy**: Ensuring sensitive data is accessible only to authorized parties.
3. **Scalability**: Handling a large number of transactions without compromising performance.
4. **Interoperability**: Ensuring the blockchain can interact with other systems and blockchains.
5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Adhering to laws and regulations specific to the industry and region.

##### Execute Contracts

**Execute Contracts** refers to running smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements with the terms directly written into code. These contracts automatically enforce and execute the terms when conditions are met, reducing the need for intermediaries and increasing efficiency.

##### State Machine Replication

**State Machine Replication** ensures all nodes in the network maintain the same state by processing the same sequence of transactions. This technique is crucial for achieving consistency and reliability in distributed systems.

### Overview of Consensus Models for Permissioned Blockchain

#### Distributed Consensus in Closed Environments

In a **closed environment**, consensus mechanisms ensure that all authorized nodes agree on the state of the blockchain. This is simpler than in open environments due to the controlled access and trusted participants.

#### Paxos

**Paxos** is a consensus algorithm that ensures a distributed system agrees on a single value. It works in three phases: proposal, acceptance, and learning. Each phase involves multiple rounds of communication to achieve agreement among the nodes.

#### RAFT Consensus

**RAFT** is a consensus algorithm designed to be understandable and easier to implement than Paxos. It elects a leader node that manages the replication of log entries. If the leader fails, a new leader is elected.

#### Byzantine General Problem

The **Byzantine General Problem** is a situation in distributed systems where nodes must agree on a strategy to avoid failure, despite the presence of some unreliable or malicious nodes. The challenge is to achieve consensus even with faulty nodes.

#### Byzantine Fault Tolerant System

A **Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) System** can continue to function correctly even if some of the nodes are unreliable or malicious. BFT systems are crucial for maintaining security and reliability in distributed environments.

#### Lamport-Shostak-Pease BFT Algorithm

The **Lamport-Shostak-Pease Algorithm** is an early solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem. It ensures consensus among nodes even if some nodes act maliciously. The algorithm requires a minimum of 3m+1 nodes to tolerate m faulty nodes.

#### BFT Over Asynchronous Systems

In asynchronous systems, there is no assumption about the time it takes for messages to be delivered. **BFT over asynchronous systems** ensures that even without timing guarantees, consensus can be achieved. These algorithms are more complex but provide greater flexibility and robustness.
